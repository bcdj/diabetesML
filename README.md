Deploying machine learning to predict diabetes for pre-diabetic patients

Cynthia Chen, The Harker School

Diabetes is one of the most common causes of death. However, the problem of predicting diabetes onset for prediabetic patients remains unsolved. In this project, we aim to accurately predict and classify whether a prediabetic patient will be diagnosed with diabetes in the future using statistical machine learning techniques.
